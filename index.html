<!--Instructions: Create a new website using HTML and Bootstrap. 
    The website must include the following:
        At least 2 pages.
        A Bootstrap navbar, table, and form.
        Bootstrap grid used throughout to format elements
        Elements should stack vertically when the window is small
    As I was using Bootstrap 4.4.1, I consulted the documentation for that version:
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/ -->

<!--When only using Bootstrap and not a separate CSS file, I had to add a class to the body to give the page
a background color.-->
<body class="bg-dark">
    <!--I began by choosing a navbar from the Bootstrap documentation to copy and paste at the top. I then changed
    the navbar settings to fit the look I wanted for the page. I also set ml-auto to place the navbar links to the
    right of the page and linked and labeled my pages. I chose to make three pages instead of two, as this first one
    will be a landing page with the table and form on the other two.-->
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-info">

    <!--I added margins as well as padding for medium and up screens to push the content of the main page more to
    the center and keep it looking neater. Keeping the padding only on medium and up screens allows for the small
    view to not be constricted while still providing more empty space on larger screens.-->
    <main class="mx-3 mt-3 px-md-5 bg-secondary">
        <!--I used classes to center the header and give it a border. The padding keeps the border from overlapping
        with the y in Society.-->

      <!--I used class="row" to place both small sections on one line when the page is wide enough. I styled them
      with borders and background colors to offer some visual diversity.-->
      <div class="row">
        <!--While the row is a div, I used section, header, paragraph, and list tags for the rest of the content.-->
        <section class="col-lg border rounded-lg border-dark">
          <!--For these sections, I gave the headers a separate background color to make them pop. Unlike the top header,
          I didn't feel that these ones needed padding.-->

          <p class="text-left">We are a non-profit organization dedicated to the restoration and preservation of historic sites throughout
            the continent of Terraris. Though our main office is in Faren, we have members from many nationalities and 
            have opened small branches in several cities. All revenue generated from donations and our campaigns goes
            to our projects and those working hard to complete them.

        <!--I changed colors for the second section so that they will be even more distinct when stacked. Due to the way
        that the cards below also alternate, it makes the full-sized page half of each color scheme.-->

      <!--Another row. This time, I copied and pasted an example of a card from the Booststrap documentation. I added
      the images and alt text, as well as setting them to columns and changing their background and button colors and
      centering the text.-->
